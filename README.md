BrowserDetection
================

A js file that pulls browser, os and more from the client for reporting purposes.

This is a work in progress, but the end goal is to create a small file or plugin that can grab user information.
I know Browser Detection or Sniffing is considered largely a bad idea in the Web Community, but the reason I am writing this is not to use it to do anything specific based on browsers.  Rather I find a need for Statistics on Browser and OS usage as well as reporting purposes back to the client of some information (depending on the user) that they may not always be readily aware of.

Browser Detection has been tested on:
IE 2 - 11
Chrome 19 - 41
Firefox: current
Safari: 5.1.7
Maxthon: current
